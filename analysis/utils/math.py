def adaptive_mean_threshold(array, window_size, c):

    Apply adaptive mean thresholding to an input array.

    Parameters:

    - window_size (int): Size of the square neighborhood for local threshold calculation.
                         Must be an odd positive integer.
    - c (float): Constant value subtracted from the local mean to determine the threshold.

    Returns:
    - ndarray: Binary array obtained after thresholding, where 1 indicates values above the threshold

    Raises:
    - AssertionError: If the window_size is not an odd positive integer.

    Note:
    - This function applies adaptive mean thresholding to each pixel in the input array.
    - The local threshold is calculated using a square neighborhood centered at each pixel,
      where the size of the neighborhood is determined by the window_size parameter.
