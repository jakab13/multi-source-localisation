# Task: find the loudness threshold of a noise that masks the content of a speech sound
# Use an "adaptive staircase" method from slab to find this loudness threshold for every participant
# generate a unique participant ID DONE
# load sound files of speech sounds (talker counting from 1-10)
# generate a masker noise
# set up an adaptive staircase that changes the level of the masker on each step
# each round of the staircase should play a random speech sound and the masker at the same time
# ask for participant to indicate which number they have heard
# check if participant response was correct
# save data once the threshold is reached (don't forget to add participant ID)
# extra 1: rove the loudness of both the talker and the masker
# extra 2: extend the above for speech sounds of multiple talkers
# extra 3: vocode the speech sounds and use those as maskers
